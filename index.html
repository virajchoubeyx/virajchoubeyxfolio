                <p>A 22 year old - recent computer science graduate.</p>
                <hr>
                <br>
                <p>
                    As a passionate computer science graduate dedicated to continual learning and professional
                    advancement, I bring forth a wealth of expertise and a commitment to excellence. With a solid
                    foundation in programming languages such as Java and hands-on experience in database management
                    systems like MySQL, I've honed my skills in Object-Oriented Programming and Data Structures. This
                    proficiency serves as a cornerstone for my endeavors in the tech industry, enabling me to tackle
                    complex challenges with confidence and precision.</p>
                <p>Furthermore, my journey in technology extends beyond the basics, as I actively pursue mastery in
                    full-stack development, with a particular focus on the MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js)
                    stack. Additionally, my adeptness in Flutter and Dart empowers me to efficiently craft
                    cross-platform mobile applications that resonate with modern users. This diversified skill set
                    underscores my versatility and readiness to embrace emerging technologies, ensuring that I remain at
                    the forefront of innovation.</p>
                <p>During my tenure as a Meta API expert, I had the privilege of collaborating with over 150 clients,
                    gaining invaluable insights into the intricacies of API integration and refining my problem-solving
                    abilities. This experience not only solidified my technical prowess but also enhanced my
                    interpersonal skills, allowing me to effectively communicate complex concepts to diverse
                    stakeholders.</p>
                <p>In my pursuit of excellence, I've actively contributed to the development of intuitive websites,
                    productive applications, and engaging web games, each project serving as a testament to my
                    dedication to delivering high-quality solutions. As I embark on the next phase of my career, I am
                    eager to leverage my diverse skill set and knowledge to make meaningful contributions to future
                    projects and initiatives. With a keen focus on continuous growth and an unwavering passion for
                    technology, I am poised to thrive in any challenge that comes my way, driving innovation and
                    delivering impactful results.</p>
